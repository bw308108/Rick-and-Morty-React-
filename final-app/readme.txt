This was my capstone project for Coding Temple.

We were required to build a web application with a framework, interacting with a database, and allow for interaction with a third-party web API.

For my web application, I chose to use React for the framework, firebase for the database, and the Rick and Morty third-party api.

In this web application, the user can create an account then search for any of their favortie chracters from the six seasons of Rick and Morty.


To run the app, follow the below instructions.
git clone (repository url)
cd (local repository)
npm install
npm start
